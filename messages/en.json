    "SkillsText2": ", I'm fascinated by the infinite possibilities in the world of coding. My current focus lies in building modern web applications with Next.js, while continuously expanding my technical toolkit. Beyond frontend development, I've gained valuable insights into backend technologies, working with databases and headless CMS solutions. I'm passionate about creating intuitive user experiences and constantly enhance my skills through hands-on project work, developing both websites and applications. My curiosity drives me to stay current with emerging technologies and best practices in the ever-evolving development landscape.",
    "TRANS": "TRANSLATION",
    "TransText": "As a translator with a Master's degree in Translatology, I specialize in precise and culturally nuanced translations between German, French, and English. My expertise has been shaped through extensive freelance work across diverse projects, complemented by immersive experiences living in West African countries like Togo and Niger. This combination of academic foundation, professional practice, and cultural immersion enables me to deliver translations that are not only linguistically accurate but also culturally authentic. I bring particular attention to capturing subtle meanings and contextual nuances that are essential for effective cross-cultural communication."

    "PrDev": "In September, I successfully completed an intensive training program at Devhaus Leipzig, where I pursued my goal of becoming a front-end developer. During this program, I gained a comprehensive understanding of front-end development fundamentals, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Next.js. I also acquired valuable insights into backend technologies such as Node.js, Express, and SQL. While the course was challenging at times and truly pushed me to my limits, it was an incredibly rewarding experience that allowed me to grow both technically and personally. The program also covered essential design principles, focusing on UI/UX and Figma, and equipped me with practical knowledge of tools like Git, Docker, Prisma, and VS Code. Through hands-on team and solo projects that simulated real-world scenarios, I developed the skills and confidence needed to apply my new expertise in professional settings.",

    "titleBi": "Website for a Bike Manufacturer",
    "PrBike": "This was my first project after completing the bootcamp‚Äîa website for a friend who manufactures custom cargobikes. While I created the design in Figma, it was tailored to my friend's wishes and vision for the site. I built the website with Next.js for a fast, modern experience. I used Sanity as the headless CMS to manage content seamlessly. It was a great opportunity to apply everything I've learned, experiment with new technologies, and gain hands-on experience in web development.",
    "titleWer": "An idea for an app: WerIstSchuld?",
    "PrWer": "For a future project, I want to focus on the topic of tax fraud and social fraud. My plan is to develop an app that processes and interconnects official statistical data on these issues. Using engaging animations and interactive features, the app will provide users with insights into the financial impacts and potential courses of action. Additionally, I intend to include example calculations to illustrate how the funds lost to tax fraud could be redirected for social purposes. Sadly, this is still only an idea"

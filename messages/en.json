    "TRANS": "TRANSLATION",
    "TransText": "As a translator with a Master's degree in Translatology, I specialize in precise and culturally nuanced translations between German, French, and English. My expertise has been shaped through extensive freelance work across diverse projects, complemented by immersive experiences living in West African countries like Togo and Niger. This combination of academic foundation, professional practice, and cultural immersion enables me to deliver translations that are not only linguistically accurate but also culturally authentic. I bring particular attention to capturing subtle meanings and contextual nuances that are essential for effective cross-cultural communication."
